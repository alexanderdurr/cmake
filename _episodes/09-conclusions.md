## Conclusions

- Powerful cross-platform build systems generator.
- Very good reference-style documentation.
- For larger projects you probably want to write a lightweight scaffold around CMake.
- Many projects use CMake in other words you are not alone if you look for a solution.
- [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and **other GitHub repositories
  are a good resource for solutions**.


### Critique

- Absolute paths (you cannot move a configured project to a different path).
- Very few good *and* free CMake tutorials are available.
